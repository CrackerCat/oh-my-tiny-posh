- Hostname completion for SSH.
- Some handy keyboard mappings, such as Ctrl+A, Ctrl+W, etc.
- Current session indications (hostname, current user, exit code of last command)

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 1703 or above for the colorful theme.
- `~/.ssh/config`, if you want to use the hostname completion for SSH.

## Installation

To enable the config edit your PowerShell profile:

```powershell
if (!(Test-Path -Path $PROFILE )) { New-Item -Type File -Path $PROFILE -Force }
notepad $PROFILE
```

Append the contents of the `profile.ps` to your PowerShell profile.

That is it.
